# Subreddit Design for r/SpaceX & r/SpaceXLounge

The **MaxQ** theme is used on r/SpaceX & r/SpaceXLounge.

This repository holds all the necessary assets, styles, and buildsteps necessary to generate a working, paste-able copy of the r/SpaceX & r/SpaceXLounge CSS directly into the subreddit stylesheet.

## How to Build

Edit the styles you wish, and then run either the `generate-spacex` or `generated-spacexlounge` task to generate a build for that subreddit. The output will appear as either `spacex.css` or `spacexlounge.css` in the `/build` directory.

## Bugs

If you find a bug with the subreddit design at reddit.com/r/spacex, feel free to either message the moderators there or log an issue here on the repository.
